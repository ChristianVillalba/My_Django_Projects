CLASS BASED VIEWS

Description:
This project displays a list of schools and we can see:
Information about the school: Name, Principal, Location, 
Information about the students: Name & Age.
We can change the Name of the school and who is the Principal with the Update Button,
We can Modify the informatin about Schools and Students from the Admin Page:
This is just an example about how to use Views and update the information in the database.
Giving everybody the power to change the Name of the School or the Principal doesn't make sense, 
however, it was an easy way to populate and group the information in the database.


What I've learned with this project:
-Convert a "Hello World" Function Based View into a Class Based View (basic_app)
-Django provides really powerful tools to use OOP and classes to define views
-DETAILED VIEW AND LIST VIEW
List the records from the model or show details of a single record
-ADVANCE CLASS BASED VIEWS
(advcbv)
Working with models and databases we will need to perform the basic actions:
Create Retrive Update Delete 
-CRUD Views (Create Retrive Update Delete)
