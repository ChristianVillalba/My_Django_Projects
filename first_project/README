My First Project using Python & Django

What I've learned with this project:
-Starting a Django project
-Starting a Django application
-Connecting our Django App & Django project.
-Creating a view and mapping to a URL (using RegEx)
-Transfearable projects, dynamically generate a file path regardless the Operative System
-Using Templates (contains the static parts of our HTML)
-CSS as Static File (create continuity through our pages)
-Models, Databases and relationships
-Migrations: Django creates a DQL database that correspond to the created models.
-Django Admin Interface

Populations Scripts:
populate_first_app file
-Faker library: populate the models with data
-Creating the scripts that will populate our database
